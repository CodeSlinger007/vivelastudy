# Open a Bank account

A foreign student can open a bank account in any bank in France. The different banks have branches in most cities; just open the door and make an appointment with a counsellor.

### Documents needed to open a bank account:

- Passport
- Visa
- An attestation of enrolment or a student card
- Housing proof (Rental contract or Registration letter)

:::info
If you are living at a relative place : ["Attestation d'hebergement"](https://www.service-public.fr/simulateur/calcul/AttestationHebergement) = Attestation saying that you live there + proof of housing from that person + copy of his/her ID (residential permit)
:::

You'll need a French bank account for the following:

- Enroll and pay your transportation subscription monthly.
- Enroll and get reimbursement from the French universal health system (Social Security)
- Pay your rent and tution fee by bank transfer
- Get CAF financial help (housing subsidy from French government)
- Any other subscription (phone, internet)

:::tip
Be careful: Never give original documents away. The bank will make copies!

DO NOT BE LATE, for a bank appointment if you are
late 10 mins they will cancel your appointment. Being late is
considered very disrespectful here.

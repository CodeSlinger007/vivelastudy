# Validate your Visa (OFII)

If you came to France with a long stay visa used as residence permit (VLS-TS in French), you must validate your visa as soon as you arrive in France. The process is entirely digital: you can do everything remotely, at home, on your computer. You must validate your visa within 3 months of arriving in France at the very latest.

## What do you need to validate your VLS-TS visa?

You will need:

- a valid email address,
- information on your visa,
- your date of arrival in France,
- your home address in France,
- a bank card to pay online the fee for issuing the residence permit.

What if you do not have a bank card?<br/>

- Don't worry! You can buy an electronic stamp (timbre Ã©lectronique) at a kiosk, at a dedicated terminal, and pay in cash.
- You can ask your friend to make the payment and settle the cost with them.

## Why is it important to validate your VLS-TS Visa?

- Lawfully remain in France for your visa's entire validity period.
- Leave France, beyond the 3 months following your arrival, without asking for a visa to come back.
